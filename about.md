## Hi. I'm Carlos.

My name is Carlos Schults, and this is my professional blog (not that I have a personal blog.) I'm a software developer, consultant, instructor, and technical author. As a programmer, most of my experience is with C#
and the .NET framework, but I've also worked with PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, Kotlin and other languages.

Most of my work as a technical writer has been done in partnership with [Hit Subscribe](https://hitsubscribe.com), for which I work as a freelance author, having written close to 200 article for clients such as NDepend, NCrunch, Submain, Testim.io, TechBeacon, and many more.

As an instructor, I've taught for [ASPE Training](https://aspetraining.com/) and I've recently created an English course targeted at Brazilian software developers.
